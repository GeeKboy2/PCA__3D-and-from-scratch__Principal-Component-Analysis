# PCA_from_scratch

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used in data analysis and machine learning. It is a dimensionality reduction method that transforms a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. 

The goal of PCA is to identify patterns in data, project the data onto a new set of dimensions, and keep only the most important information while reducing the size of the data. This process can simplify the data and make it easier to visualize, while retaining most of the information in the original data.
