# PCA Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used in data analysis and machine learning. It is a dimensionality reduction method that transforms a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. 

The goal of PCA is to identify patterns in data, project the data onto a new set of dimensions, and keep only the most important information while reducing the size of the data. This process can simplify the data and make it easier to visualize, while retaining most of the information in the original data.

# PCA from scratch

In this project, I will be implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch. 
The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of how PCA works and to demonstrate its capabilities in data analysis. To achieve this, I will be using the "pca_from_scratch" file, which will serve as a platform for developing and testing my implementation of PCA. 

Throughout the process, I will be following the steps involved in PCA, including data preprocessing, computation of covariance matrix, computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and dimensionality reduction. The final result of this project will be a complete and functional implementation of PCA that can be applied to various datasets. I am looking forward to exploring the potential of PCA and gaining valuable insights into the world of data analysis through this project.

In my next phase of exploring Principal Component Analysis (PCA), I plan to delve deeper into the technique and its applications. In particular, I want to extend my understanding of PCA beyond the traditional two-dimensional representations to a three-dimensional scale. 

Instead of using the circle of correlation, which is a commonly used visual representation of the relationships between variables, I want to explore the use of a sphere of correlation. 
This will provide a more comprehensive view of the relationships between variables and enable me to better understand the structure of the data. By applying PCA on a three-dimensional scale using a sphere of correlation, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the method and its potential for data analysis. I am eager to see the results of this experiment and to expand my knowledge of PCA in the process.
